Online Store
Example use of REST with Hibernate

Revision History
================
1 - Blaine Mincey(blaine.mincey@redhat.com) - Initial version

Overview
========
This is to be somewhat of a skeleton application that can
be used for many different things.  It implements Hibernate
to access a MySQL database.  From here, a multitude of 
different things can be implemented.  The first is a REST Web
Service. At the moment, Customers is the only table that
has any type of functionality.  WORK IN PROGRESS 

This has been tested on JBoss EAP 5.1.1.

System Requirements
===================
- Maven 2.x or higher
- JDK 1.6.x

Required modifications
======================
Within OnlineStore-Entity, go to the directory src/main/resources.
Here is the onlineStore.sql that can be executed on a MySQL 5.x
database.  First create a database, i.e., OnlineStore.  Then, 
within this newly created database, run the onlineStore.sql script.

Now, within the same directory (src/main/resources) in OnlineStore-Entity, 
edit OnlineStore-mysql-ds.xml.  Modify the security credentials and replace
MY_USERNAME and MY_PASSWORD with the appropriate values.  This file
should be copied to the EAP server config's deploy directory.

Build the Application
=====================
To build the application (EAR file), go into the OnlineStore-Parent
directory.  There is only one file here, pom.xml.
